    title="Hawaiana"
    description="Hawaiian pizza is known for its distinctive combination of sweet and savory flavors. The main ingredients are pieces of pineapple and ham, arranged on a base of tomato sauce and topped with mozzarella cheese. The pineapple provides a juicy sweetness that contrasts with the saltier, richer flavor of ham, creating a unique flavor experience. It is often a topic of debate among pizza enthusiasts, but remains a popular choice on many menus."
