    title="Mushrooms"
	description="This pizza features fresh or seasoned mushrooms as the main ingredient. The mushrooms are spread over a layer of mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. Different types of mushrooms can be used, such as white or portobello, and are often complemented by garlic, onion, and herbs to enhance its flavor. The texture of the mushrooms, along with the melted cheese and crispy crust, makes this pizza a delicious and popular option."
