    title="Pepperoni"
    description="Pepperoni pizza is a universally loved classic. It is characterized by its generous pepperoni topping, which is a type of spicy and slightly smoked salami. This sausage is placed on a layer of melted mozzarella cheese and a base of rich and tasty tomato sauce. The dough can range from thin and crispy to thick and fluffy, depending on the style. Pepperoni, when cooked, releases oils that mix with the cheese, creating a distinctive and delicious flavor."
